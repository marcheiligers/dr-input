# dr-input

A simple input control for DragonRuby.

The Multiline input is fast enough to edit _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ (~170k character), but _War and Peace_ (~3.3M characters) is over the limits. This limit doesn't appear to be related to the code, as even loading the _War and Peace_ text file takes multiple seconds (M1 Pro Max). I have not explored where the limit is beyond a simple experiment with these two files from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org), but if you need to edit a reasonable sized novel, perhaps a chapter-based approach is better anyway.

## Usage

Grab the latest single file release `input.rb` from the [Releases](https://github.com/marcheiligers/dr-input/releases) page and save it in your DragonRuby game folder (I'm assuming in a `lib` directory in the sample below).


```ruby
require 'lib/input.rb'

def tick(args)
  # Create an input
  args.state.input ||= Input::Text.new(x: 100, y: 600, w: 300, focussed: true)

  # Allow the input to process inputs and render text (render_target)
  args.state.input.tick

  # Get the value
  args.state.input_value = args.state.input.value

  # Output the input
  args.outputs.primitives << args.state.input

  # Output the value
  args.outputs.debug << { x: 100, y: 100, text: args.state.input_value }.label!
end
```

See `app/main.rb` for a more complex example.


### Constructor Arguments

#### Colors

Color arguments can be passed as `Hash`es or `Array`s suffixed with `_color`, or individual `Integer` values suffixed with `_r`, `_g`, `_b`, `_a`. In all cases, if a color element is missing, the corresponding default value will be used.

For example, for the `prompt` you can pass:
* A `prompt_color` as a `Hash`, like `{ r: 100, g: 100, b: 100, a: 255 }`
* A `prompt_color` as an `Array`, like `[100, 100, 100, 255]`
* A `prompt_color` as an `Integer`, like `0xFF33BB` or `0xFF33BBFF`
* Individual `prompt_r`, `prompt_g`, `prompt_b` and `prompt_a` `Integer` values

**NOTE**: For Integer (hex) rgba to work, there has to be a red component > 0. If you need red to be zero, use the `Hash` or `Array` format

The argument list below will list `prompt_color` but not the individual `prompt_*` values.

#### Arguments

* `#replace_at(text, start, end = start)` - Alias for `#insert_at(text, start, end = start)`
* `#append(text)` - Appends text the end of the value, without changing the selection
* `#delete_forward` - Deletes selection or the character to the right of the cursor location if the selection is empty (typically in response to the `Delete` key)
* `#delete_back` - Deletes selection or the character to the left of the cursor location if the selection is empty (typically in response to the `Backspace` key)

* `#move_page_down` - Move the cursor one page up (`Multiline` only)
* `#select_all` - Select all
* `#select_to_start` - Select to the start of the text value
* `#select_to_line_start` - Select to the start of the current line (`Multiline` only)
* `#select_word_left` - Select a word to the left

* `#blur` - Removes the focus from the instance. This happens immediately and the instance will not process keyboard and some mouse events after being blurred.
* `#focussed?` - Returns true if the input is focussed, false otherwise
* `#focused?` - Alias for `#focussed?`
* `#value_changed?` - Returns true if the input value changed in the last tick, false otherwise

## Custom keyboard handling

There may be cases where you want to do some custom keyboard handling, like filtering out certain characters. In order to do this, create a subclass of `Input::Text` or `Input::Multiline` and override the `handle_keyboard` method, calling `super` when your special handling is done. The following instance variables are available:

* `@meta` - true if the Meta key is down (the Command key on a Mac, or Windows key on Windows)
* `@alt` - true if the Alt key is down
* `@shift` - true if the Shift key is down or `shift_lock` is set
* `@ctrl` - true if the Control key is down
* `@down_keys` - an `Array` of `Symbol`s of keys that are down excluding the special keys above
* `@text_keys` - an `Array` of printable characters that has been typed this tick

### Example: filtering

``` ruby
class FilenameInput < Input::Text
  ALLOWED_CHARS = ('a'..'z').to_a + ('A'..'Z').to_a + ('0'..'9').to_a + ['_', '-', '.']

  def handle_keyboard
    @text_keys.select! { |key| ALLOWED_CHARS.include?(key) }

    super
  end
end
```

## Console replacement

This library includes the ability to replace the default DragonRuby Console (`~`). Simply call `Input.replace_console!` once to enable this.

## Notes

* Adding a `background_color` significantly improves the rendering of the text.

The autocomplete menu is drawn by the input by default, but this might cause layering issues where the menu draw behind other elements on the screen. Setting `draw_autocomplete_menu` to false allows you to add the `#autocomplete_menu` into the outputs whereever you like.

## Thanks

* @danhealy for Zif. The Zif Input was the starting point for this. Though you wouldn't be able to tell now, it was a really solid place to start.
* @leviondiscord (on Discord, aka @leviongithub) for suggesting `#delete_prefix` when I would have done something much dumber. And also providing other interesting methods I'm likely to use at some point.
* @DarkGriffin (on Discord) for requesting this control in the first place, and not being shy about the _crazy_ desired feature list (of which, I feel like, I've only touched the surface).
* @aquillo (on Discord) for asking me (and others) to review his code, where I learnt that the value returned by `keyboard.key` is the `tick_count` the key was pressed which made implementing key repeat much simpler than the silly thing I would've done.
* @cookie (on Discord) for reigniting my interest in building this control by asking about how to use it, finding a new, novel use for it, and pushing me to improve the sample(s).
* @kfischer_okarin (on Discord, aka @kfischer-okarin) for contributing `size_px`, and fixing (or forcing me to fix) the tests. This input is used in his product [Palantir](https://kfischer-okarin.itch.io/palantir) which you should check out.
* @pvande (on Discord and GitHub) for requesting resizing and font size changes for his own nefarious needs in a CSS-like layout system, which I have interest in (and also pointing out a left over `puts` debug)
