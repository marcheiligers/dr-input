# dr-input

A simple input control for DragonRuby.

The Multiline input is fast enough to edit _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ (~170k character), but _War and Peace_ (~3.3M characters) is over the limits. This limit doesn't appear to be related to the code, as even loading the _War and Peace_ text file takes multiple seconds (M1 Pro Max). I have not explored where the limit is beyond a simple experiment with these two files from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org), but if you need to edit a reasonable sized novel, perhaps a chapter-based approach is better anyway.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'lib/input.rb'

def tick(args)
  # Create an input
  args.state.input ||= Input::Text.new(x: 100, y: 600, w: 300)

  # Allow the input to process inputs and render text (render_target)
  args.state.input.tick

  # Get the value
  args.state.input_value = args.state.input.value

  # Output the input
  args.outputs.primitives << args.state.input
end
```

See `app/main.rb` for a more complex example.

* `max_length` - maximum allowed length (Integer), default `false` which disables length checks

### Attribute accessors

* `value` - The current value
* `selection_start` - The start of the current selection
* `selection_end` - The end of the current selection. This is the cursor location.
* `lines` - The value broken into individual lines (readonly, `Multiline` only)
* `content_w` - The width of the full content (`value`) as rendered (readonly, `Text` only)
* `content_h` - The height of the full content (`value`) as rendered (readonly, `Multiline` only)
* `rect` - Returns the control's containing rect as a hash (readonly)

### Instance Methods

* `#insert(text)` - Inserts text at the cursor location, or replaces if there's a selection
* `#replace(text)` - Alias for `#insert(text)`
* `#current_selection` - Returns the currently selected text
* `#current_line` - Returns the currently selected line object
* `#current_word` - Returns the word currently under the cursor
* `#find(text)` - Selects the searched for text if found
* `#find_next` - Selects the next instance of the currently selected text
* `#find_prev` - Selects the previous instance of the currently selected text
* `#cut` - Cut selection to `$clipboard`
* `#copy` - Copy selection to `$clipboard`
* `#paste` - Paste value in `$clipboard`
* `#move_to_start` - Move to the start of the current line
* `#move_word_left` - Move the cursor a word to the left
* `#move_char_left` - Move the cursor a character to the left
* `#move_word_right` - Move the cursor a word to the right
* `#move_char_right` - Move the cursor a character to the right
* `#move_line_up` - Move the cursor one line up (`Multiline` only)
* `#move_line_down` - Move the cursor one line up (`Multiline` only)
* `#move_page_up` - Move the cursor one page up (`Multiline` only)
* `#move_page_down` - Move the cursor one page up (`Multiline` only)
* `#select_all` - Select all
* `#select_to_start` - Select to the start of the text value
* `#select_to_line_start` - Select to the start of the current line (`Multiline` only)
* `#select_word_left` - Select a word to the left
* `#select_char_left` - Select a character to the left
* `#select_to_end` - Select to the end of the text value
* `#select_to_line_end` - Select to the end of the current line (`Multiline` only)
* `#select_word_right` - Select a word to the right
* `#select_char_right` - Select a character to the right
* `#select_line_up` - Select one line up (`Multiline` only)
* `#select_line_down` - Select one line down (`Multiline` only)
* `#select_page_up` - Select one page up (`Multiline` only)
* `#select_page_down` - Select one page down (`Multiline` only)
* `#focus` - Focusses the instance. Note the instance will only receive the focus after it's rendered. This prevents multiple instances from handling the keyboard and mouse events in the same tick.
* `#blur` - Removes the focus from the instance. This happens immediately and the instance will not process keyboard and some mouse events after being blurred.
* `#focussed?` - Returns true if the input is focussed, false otherwise

## Notes

* Adding a `background_color` significantly improves the rendering of the text.

## Thanks

* @danhealy for Zif. The Zif Input was the starting point for this. Though you wouldn't be able to tell now, it was a really solid place to start.
* @leviondiscord (on Discord, aka @leviongithub) for suggesting `#delete_prefix` when I would have done something much dumber. And also providing other interesting methods I'm likely to use at some point.
* @DarkGriffin (on Discord) for requesting this control in the first place, and not being shy about the _crazy_ desired feature list (of which, I feel like, I've only touched the surface).
* @aquillo (on Discord) for asking me (and others) to review his code, where I learnt that the value returned by `keyboard.key` is the `tick_count` the key was pressed which made implementing key repeat much simpler than the silly thing I would've done.
